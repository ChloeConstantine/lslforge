# LSLForge

LSLForge is a fork of the popular LSLPlus editing evironment, to provide Linden Scripting Language (LSL) support in Eclipse.

## Description

LSLForge is a plugin for the Eclipse platform. The plugin allows editing, "compiling" (gathering code included in modules), executing, and unit testing your Second Life® Linden Scripting Language (LSL) code.

Because it is an Eclipse plugin, when you use LSL Plus you can take advantage of many of the useful features of Eclipse. Integrated support of a source code control system such as CVS or Subversion comes for "free", and there are many other features -- task list management, integration with bug tracking tools, etc. You will of course need to make sure you get the appropriate plugins to use these features.
